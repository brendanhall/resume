\section{Prior Professional Experience}
\begin{small}
\cventry{2001 - 2002}{Master Software Engineer}{Hamilton Sundstrand, Electric Power Systems}{}{}{Generic duties included the development of aircraft utility control software for the secondary power distribution cabinet architecture. SW developed in accordance with DO178B, utilizing the Shlaer/Mellor development methodology. Target platform was a MPC750 processor using DiabData C and a proprietary time and space partitioned OS.}
\cvline{}{Championed and led a pilot study to use COTS tools (MATLAB, Beacon-for-Simulink, DOORS) with in-house scripts for the automatic code generation of avionics utility control software demonstrating significant productivity gain.}
\cvline{}{Produced influential internal white paper on the application of TTP to secondary power distribution architecture}

%%%\ TUCSON
\cventry{1998 - 2001}{Principal Software Engineer}{Honeywell Engines and Systems}{Tucson, AZ}{}{Generic responsibilities included the design and development of embedded C++ APU Engine Control Software to DO178B. Development tools include Microtec/Diab C++ under UNIX/NT and Rational Rose UML. Platforms include single and dual6833x, MPC509, using in house simple schedulers and COTS RTOS (VRTX) . CVS and Clear Case used for CM.}
\cvline{}{One of the prime architects of Tucson's \textbf{Modular Aerospace Control (MAC)} a modular FADEC architecture based upon a TTP/C based fault-tolerant backbone. MAC was awarded research funding from NASA and has been successful in winning significant new business for the Tucson site.}
\cvline{}{\textbf{Honeywell Data Monitor (HDM)}. I led the development of a Windows based tool for target based software monitoring and qualification testing. HDM comprised a win32 (Microsoft Visual C++, MFC, COM) based automation server hosting the script language Python. The tool was successfully deployed (100+ users) to support AS900 engine (D0-178B) certification.}
\cvline{}{I also initiated and supported the deployment of National Instrument's Lab Windows CVI and Test Stand to the Tucson production environment}
\cventry{1993 - 1998}{Software Engineer}{Motorola, AIEG}{Stotfold, UK}{}{}
\cvline{}{Responsibilities included the strategic planning of test methods and the design of test platforms for new products (automotive power-train ECUs) under development in the department. The work included the design of ATP and environmental stress screening (ESS) systems, in C, C++ and Assembler (68xxxx). Test hardware included ISA, GPIB and VXI instrumentation; the software platforms in use were Microtec, Borland 4.5, Lab-Windows CVI, SourceSafe (for CM).}
\cvline{}{Championed new modular test development SW architecture that reduced test development time by 8X. Pioneered BDM based test techniques that enabled increased coverage for \emph{Chip-On-Board} based products, and enabled analog in-circuit test systems to achieve digital component test coverage. Traveled to partner companies and sites in Europe to consult and train people in new test techniques.}
\cventry{1993 - 1995}{Test Development Engineer}{Motorola, AIEG}{Stotfold, UK}{}{Responsibilities included the design and continuous improvement of test systems for an ISDN PC based video conferencing system. Test systems developed included PC GPIB, and VXI based functional and parametric quality audit systems. Tests implemented to meet BABT manufacturing approval. Activities also included the proving and validation of test equipment; specifying GR\&R campaigns and the training of production line and analysis  personnel.}}{}{}
