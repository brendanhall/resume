					<p class="lead">
				I am a multi-disciplinary system, software, and test engineer with over 25 years of experience within safety relevant embedded system development. I have a proven track record of innovation with <a href="./bren_patents.csv">45 patents</a> awarded date. Working within Advanced Technology, I am fortunate to be able to engage and contribute on a wide range of systems and technologies, from leading edge to time-tested. My projects have ranged from developing the integrated fly-by-wire networking architecture for the Orion Space Program, to the development of low-cost partitioned systems based on field bus technologies. Aside from building cool stuff, I am also really interested in how we build systems safely. Hence, I am keenly interested in model-based development, model-based safety analysis, applied formal methods and integrated design assurance methods and technologies.  This diverse background and areas of interest have afforded me to realize in depth knowledge of fault-tolerance, system architecture, communications protocols and the practical application of aerospace development and certification standards. This high assurance experience is complemented with an earlier career spent developing video telephony and high-volume automotive engine control systems, where I worked within design validation and production test rolls.</p>

							<h4  class="media-heading primary-color"> Successful Record of Funded Research Wins and Execution </h4>
                           		<p>A primary goal of Advanced Technology is to attract research funding. To support this goal, I have established strong collaborative research partnerships and successfully led several funded research programs. Selected ongoing and past projects are highlighted below:
								<ul>
									<li> <strong> FAA - Complex Systems </strong> (2015 - 2017). Working with MIT, NDU and Certification Services Inc., this project is exploring the issues related to modern complex systems, and technologies ad development strategies that can reduce system development risks. 
									<li> <strong> NASA - AFFIRM </strong> (2013 - 2017). Partnering with Galois Inc.,  this program explored the application of Domain Specific Language (DSL) and related syntheses technologies to analyze and implement provably correct distributed systems.
									<li> <strong> NASA - CERTWARE</strong> (2013 - 2016). Partnering with Kestrel Technology, this program is developing an eclipse based certification workbench, integrating safety and assurance case notations, natural language with formal assurance case reasoning.
									<li> <strong> NASA - AFCS </strong> (2013). Partnering with SRI and WWTechnology, this research program targeted the application of formal architectural modeling and formal methods to distributed fault-tolerant architectures.
									<li> <strong> FAA - Checksum and CRC Section Criteria </strong> (2013). This research worked to identify aviation best practices for the <a href="http://www.tc.faa.gov/its/worldpac/techrpt/tc14-49.pdf">Selection of Cyclic Redundancy Code and Checksum Algorithms to Ensure Critical Data Integrity </a> This work was subsequently referenced in the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_00-66.pdf">.Advisory Circular 66</a>									<!-- <li> https://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/design_approvals/air_software/media/TC-14-49.pdf -->
									<li><strong>FAA - Data Bus Handbook </strong>(2009).  The research developed the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/design_approvals/air_software/media/AR-09-24.pdf">FAA Handbook for Data Bus Evaluation</a>. The Research team comprised Honeywell, Carnegie Mellon University and Certification Services Inc.

                                <ul>

                                <li> <strong>Integrated Model-Based System, Safety And Requirements</strong>
                                	<ul>
                                		<li> For the past year, I have been pioneering the application of constrained natural language requirements specification to Honeywell system development. This work has adopted and extended the Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax (EARS), to support natural language based system specifications, whilst providing automation in the form of consistency checking and automatic test generation. 
                                		<li> A second area of focus is the Integration of model-based system engineering activities across heterogeneous tooling and modeling technologies. In this area, we are exploring model integration technologies, such as ModelBus, OSLC, FMI to support the integration and integrated analysis and behavioral evaluation of mixed technology workflows targeting AADL/SysML Simulink, Modelica and VHDL-AMS integration strategies.  
                                		<li> In 2016 I Worked with our research partners to develop a formal methods training program, which is now available on the Honeywell learning Hub.

                                	</ul>

                                <li> <strong> TTEthernet Development </strong> (2005 - 2010). I led the Honeywell team in the joint Honeywell and TTTech development of TTEthernet (SAE-AS802). The project developed and matured the technology from conception through TRL-6. This was one of the first Honeywell projects to apply 'in-line formal methods' to an active development. Following the selection TT-GbE as the by-wire backbone for the NASA Orion program, I championed and led the development of the Network Integration Lab (NIL) facility. This facility  utilized COTS hardware to emulate the full complement of Orion networked equipment. Incorporating provisions for extensive monitoring and fault injection hardware, the facility was used to formally retire the network technology risks on the Orion program. To date, no issues have been found within TTEhernet Switch nor End-System IP cores. Given that these designs were among the largest and most complex designs developed within Honeywell, this is testament to the mitigation approach and the design/verification teams.
                                <li> <strong> Other Developments include</strong>
                                	<ul> 
                                	<li> A Minimalist TTP-HUB (DO254)
                                	<li> Low-cost FlexRay Dependability Augmentation and Gateway
                                	<li> A Low-complexity Partitioned Barrel Processor
                                	<li> The Braided Ring Availability Integrity Network (BRAIN).
                                	</ul>
